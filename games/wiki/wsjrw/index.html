	  <h1>Wierd Stuff, Just Really Wierd wiki page</h1>
	  <div>I created this when I was given a project to do called Multimedia Project. I had to do this for ELA and it is just a random thing I came up with. Here is a wiki with hints and </div>
	  <div>
	    <button onclick="window.location.href='https://corraneveryone.github.io/games/wiki/wsjrw/hints';">Hints</button>
	    <button onclick="window.location.href='https://corraneveryone.github.io/games/wiki/wsjrw/awnsers';">Awnsers</button>
	  </div>
	  <div>This project was humor focused, here are some humorous elements I included within the game.</div>
	  <div>In level 4, It says that this is the beginning of the journey (and the song that plays is called Journey's Beginning from terraria) and it gives you a riddle before you go, but after you complete it, the game ends (and plays the song Journey's End from terraria)</div>
	  <div>In level 2, the 4th part is just a bunch of text that is kinda like a song, it says something about it going to be hard, even though is was very easy the whole time (The easy way is in the hints).</div>
	  <div>In level 3, the text says that the button is at the bottom of the screen, even though it isn't, it goes everywhere around the screen making it hard for you to get to it. And the text is tricking you, so don't get fooled</div>
